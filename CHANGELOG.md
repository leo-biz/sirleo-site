## v2.5 — 2026-04-30
**Fix Netlify CI build failure**
- `netlify.toml` — build command now runs `npm --prefix netlify/functions install` before version script so esbuild can resolve the `stripe` module

**Light mode polish**
- FAQ: replaced hardcoded dark-mode inline colors with CSS variables — title, subtitle, questions, answers, background all theme-aware
- Admin: nav hover, table row hover, search focus ring all invisible in light mode — fixed with proper light mode overrides

## v2.3 — 2026-04-30
**Test environment data tagging**
- `hub.js` — detects non-production hostname, flags submissions with `is_test: true` in data field
- `notify.js` — auto-created session offers get `private_notes: '[TEST]'` when submission is flagged
- Full flow still runs on dev — tags let you filter/delete test data in Supabase

- `create-checkout.js` — passes offer_id through to success URL and metadata
- Admin: Sessions page with pipeline stats (draft/sent/viewed/paid/completed/revenue)
